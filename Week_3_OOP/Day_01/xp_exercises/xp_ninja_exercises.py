# Exercise 1 : Call History
# Instructions
# Create a class called Phone. This class takes a parameter called phone_number. 

class Phone :
    
    def __init__(self, phone_number) :
        self.phone_number = phone_number
# When instantiating an object create an attribute called call_history which value is an empty list.
        self.call_history = []
# Add another attribute called messages to your __init__() method which value is an empty list.
        self.sent_messages = []
        self.received_messages = []

# Add a method called call that takes both self and other_phone (i.e another Phone object) as parameters. 
# The method should print a string stating who called who, and add this string to the phoneâ€™s call_history.
    def call(self, other_phone) :
        self.other_phone = other_phone
        print(f"{self.phone_number} called {self.other_phone}")

# Add a method called show_call_history. This method should print the call_history.
    def show_call_history(self) :
        print(self.call_history)

# Create a method called send_message which is similar to the call method. Each message should be saved as a dictionary with the following keys:
# to : the number of another Phone object
# from : your phone number (also a Phone object)
# content
