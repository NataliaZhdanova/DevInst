# Instructions
# In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
# It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

# For example, with a left shift of 3 –> D would be replaced by A,
# –> E would become B, and so on.

# The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

# Create a python program that encrypts and decrypts messages with ceasar cypher.
# The user enters the program, and then the program asks him if he wants to encrypt or decrypt, and then execute encryption/decryption on a given message and a given shift.

# Hint:

# for letter in text:
#     cypher_text += chr(ord(letter) + 3)


set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}  
set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"} 

  
set3 = {"google", "apple"}
set4 = {"ibm", "emc", "google", "amazon", "microsoft", "apple", "facebook"} 
set3.issubset(set2) 
set4.issuperset(set2) 


# there will be no 'apple' in the combined set
