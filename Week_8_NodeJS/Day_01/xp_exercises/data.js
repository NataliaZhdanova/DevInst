// ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Advanced Module Usage Using ES6 Module Syntax
// Instructions
// Create a file named data.js.

// Inside data.js, define an array of objects, each representing a person with properties like name, age, and location.

// Export the array using the ES6 module syntax.

// Create another file named app.js.

// In app.js, import the array of person objects from the data.js module.

// Write a function that calculates and prints the average age of all the persons in the array.

// Use the imported array and the average age function in app.js.

// Run app.js and confirm that the average age is correctly calculated and displayed.


let people = [
    {name: "Tony", age: 22, location: "USA"},
    {name: "Molly", age: 33, location: "Russia"},
    {name: "Mary", age: 44, location: "Israel"},
    {name: "Perry", age: 55, location: "France"},
    {name: "Bess", age: 66, location: "Japan"}
];

// module.exports = people;

export default people;
